1. upon connecting the battery, it heats up like hell. 
	-measuring the voltage on the battery shows that there is a short between power and griund
	-measuring the voltage at the terminals of the regulators shows they are not delvering proper output

		hypothese:

			-the heat damaged the voltage regulators (not correct)
			- the regulators cannot handle the load (not correct)
			- there is some kind of short between power and ground.
				- this short is inhearent in the traces (not correct)
				-this short has something to do with the components (?????)


				tests:

					- remove the regulators and test each one seperately
					- apply an external ower source to the pcb
					- apply an external power source to a blank pcb
					- take off components little by little

		results:

			- VCC's of both power regulators are connected via a relatively high (but non 0) resistance
			- desoldering the regulators shows that that resistance mentioned directly above still exists.It is massive, however, I am not convinced 	that is the problem
			- Both regulators function properly.
			- the regulator handles a motor without problem
			- When an external 5V is applied, the voltage still colapses.
			- When a blank pcb is connected to power, there is no collapse.
			-The servo chip functionsproperly, it is not what has blown up

	********After connecting a couple AA batteries in the goal of seeing what would get hot, I saw some smoke. After that, power was no longer being 	shorted. Communication with the atmega worked fine.



2. TWINT bit is not being set when the microcontroller is connected to the board.
	-

		Hypothese:
			-Something is wrong with the level shifting hadware
			-Something is wrong with one of the sensors or with the servo chip

		tests:

			- I am going to split the connections of the servo chip and the sensors apart and test them seperately
			- Now that I have some hope for the servo chip, I will call it's adress
			- try talking to the acc and gyro seperately.


		results:

			-testing the acc/gyro system by itself, the problem persists
			-testing the servo chip by itself functions.
			-Calling the servo chip's adress functions aswell, I confirm it works fine. 



3. Having th atmega 328pb instead of atmega 328
	-2 TWI interfaces
	- satus code after a start is transmitted shows that sla+r has been transmitted.




4. Neither one of the muxes seems to be working.
	
	status: resolved. I've decided to use only the interrupts and pin change interrupts



	Software:

1. header file not included for atmega 328pb
	-See if you cant modify the one for atmega 328

	status: resolved. An appropriate header filewas found on github and added to the project
