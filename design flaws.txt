1. each voltage regulator required a 10 uF cap

2. the footprints for the qfn's are far too small and the white squares are missing.

3. The back fin of the power egulators should be connected to the ground plane.

4. An IMU should have been used instead of a seperate acc and gyro.

5. Always use an external pullup resistor for the I2C lines. DO not rely on the software

6. Use the PWM pin todo mux sort of stuff.

7. ALWAYS select the cheapest and least complex approach.

8. The input capture unit (ICU) of the timers should be used to read pwm. 

9. use 2 different I2C busses when using a level shifter

10. spacing between header pins should fit a breadboard.
