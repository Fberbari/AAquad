These directories will, by the end of the project contain the code, the pcb and the mechanical design files of the AAquad.

As of now, PCB is complete. 

The functions to access the sensors are also complete (though they use polling) and can be found in c_files under AAquad_code


No mechanical design has been done as of yet. Perhaps we use a mech student?
