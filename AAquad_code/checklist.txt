Steps till end:

1. figure out gyro/ aceelerometer

2. write functions to access them 

3. figure out PWM

4. Run the motors with PWM

5. Figure out how to combine Pilot data and sensor data

6. figure out how to read pilot data

7. figure out the algorythym for combining all this and outputting to the motors

8. ???????figure out how to get the sensors to transmitt an interrupt in case of too far bank or pitch (maybe software inteerupt????)

9. Figure out all the error routines (communication broke, strange sensor data etc)
